	RDStart
		a) Left corner of the store house.

		c) At the bottom of the open cask by the main door.
				-- I don't even remember as to how I got this clue!
				-- But I can't ignore any clues. This treasure hunting is not easy.
				-- As soon as I got the chance, I inconspicuously got to the main the door.
				-- I checked the open cask and I could not see anything.
				-- I put my hand into the cask to check the bottom of the cask with murky smelly liquid!

		d) Ask master brewer for the Sunshine Rum sample.
				-- This is the first thing I did, went straight to the master brewer.
				-- I asked him " Can I get a sample of the Sunshine Rum"
				-- MB - "You need what!" he replied with little surprised look on his face.
				-- I repeated, can have some Sunshine rum?
				-- MB grumbled something under his breath and disappeared for 10- 15 minutes,leaving me confused.
				-- Finally he came back, gave me a clear looking liquid in a shot glass and asked me to drink up!
				-- I looked at the shot glass and then back at MB, he was still staring at me!
				-- I thought, whatever and drank up. I glanced at MB after taking the shot and he was still straining at me.
				-- I finally asked, "Is that it?"
				-- He kept staring at me for little more.
				-- Then he finally passed me a envelop and said "I don't know how you know Great Joe but he told me to give this to the person asking for Sunshine Rum."
			    -- Received an envelop with a map inside. This is what we were looking for. Clues to the next island.
