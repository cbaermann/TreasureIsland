			-- As I was about to leave, Sam grabbed my hand and passed me . . .
				-- a Key!
			-- He then told me sit down and informed me that he appreciate my kindness and also that he knew who I was!
			-- He knew my father and they both had a lot of adventures together. And he was able to figure out who I was while we were conversing but was not sure if I had my dad's amazing character.
